Using only a few minutes of recorded voice of a\\ngenuine client of a speaker verification system, attackers can develop a\\nvariety of spoofing attacks that might trick such systems. Detecting these\\nattacks using the audio cues present in the recordings is an important\\nchallenge. Most existing spoofing detection systems depend on knowing the used\\nspoofing technique. With this research, we aim at overcoming this limitation,\\nby examining robust audio features, both traditional and those learned through\\nan autoencoder, that are generalizable over different types of replay spoofing.\\nFurthermore, we provide a detailed account of all the steps necessary in\\nsetting up state-of-the-art audio feature detection, pre-, and postprocessing,\\nsuch that the (non-audio expert) machine learning researcher can implement such\\nsystems. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our robust replay speaker\\ndetection system with a wide variety and different combinations of both\\nextracted and machine learned audio features on the `out in the wild' ASVspoof\\n2017 dataset. This dataset contains a variety of new spoofing configurations.\\nSince our focus is on examining which features will ensure robustness, we base\\nour system on a traditional Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model.\\nWe then systematically investigate the relative contribution of each feature\\nset. The fused models, based on both the known audio features and the machine\\nlearned features respectively, have a comparable performance with an Equal\\nError Rate (EER) of 12. The final best performing model, which obtains an EER\\nof 10.8, is a hybrid model that contains both known and machine learned\\nfeatures, thus revealing the importance of incorporating both types of features\\nwhen developing a robust spoofing prediction model.\\n\",\n          \"  Most existing approaches to autonomous driving fall into one of two\\ncategories: modular pipelines, that build an extensive model of the\\nenvironment, and imitation learning approaches, that map images directly to\\ncontrol outputs. A recently proposed third paradigm, direct perception, aims to\\ncombine the advantages of both by using a neural network to learn appropriate\\nlow-dimensional intermediate representations. However, existing direct\\nperception approaches are restricted to simple highway situations, lacking the\\nability to navigate intersections, stop at traffic lights or respect speed\\nlimits. In this work, we propose a direct perception approach which maps video\\ninput to intermediate representations suitable for autonomous navigation in\\ncomplex urban environments given high-level directional inputs. Compared to\\nstate-of-the-art reinforcement and conditional imitation learning approaches,\\nwe achieve an improvement of up to 68 % in goal-directed navigation on the\\nchallenging CARLA simulation benchmark. In addition, our approach is the first\\nto handle traffic lights and speed signs by using image-level labels only, as\\nwell as smooth car-following, resulting in a significant reduction of traffic\\naccidents in simulation.\\n\",\n          \"  Random Forest (RF) is a powerful supervised learner and has been popularly\\nused in many applications such as bioinformatics.\\n  In this work we propose the guided random forest (GRF) for feature selection.\\nSimilar to a feature selection method called guided regularized random forest\\n(GRRF), GRF is built using the importance scores from an ordinary RF. However,\\nthe trees in GRRF are built sequentially, are highly correlated and do not\\nallow for parallel computing, while the trees in GRF are built independently\\nand can be implemented in parallel. Experiments on 10 high-dimensional gene\\ndata sets show that, with a fixed parameter value (without tuning the\\nparameter), RF applied to features selected by GRF outperforms RF applied to\\nall features on 9 data sets and 7 of them have significant differences at the\\n0.05 level. Therefore, both accuracy and interpretability are significantly\\nimproved. GRF selects more features than GRRF, however, leads to better\\nclassification accuracy. Note in this work the guided random forest is guided\\nby the importance scores from an ordinary random forest, however, it can also\\nbe guided by other methods such as human insights (by specifying $\\\\lambda_i$).\\nGRF can be used in \\\"RRF\\\" v1.4 (and later versions), a package that also\\nincludes the regularized random forest methods.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_abstract\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"automatic speaker verification like every biometric system vulnerable spoofing attack use minute record voice genuine client speaker verification system attacker develop variety spoofing attack might trick system detect attack use audio cue present recording important challenge exist spoof detection system depend know use spoof technique research aim overcome limitation examine robust audio feature traditional learn autoencoder generalizable different type replay spoof furthermore provide detailed account step necessary set state of the art audio feature detection pre- postprocessing non audio expert machine learn researcher implement system finally evaluate performance robust replay speaker detection system wide variety different combination extract machine learn audio feature wild asvspoof 2017 dataset dataset contain variety new spoofing configuration since focus examine feature ensure robustness base system traditional gaussian mixture model universal background model systematically investigate relative contribution feature set fuse model base know audio feature machine learn feature respectively comparable performance equal error rate eer final good performing model obtain eer hybrid model contain know machine learn feature thus reveal importance incorporate type feature develop robust spoof prediction model\",\n          \"exist approach autonomous driving fall one two category modular pipeline build extensive model environment imitation learn approach map image directly control output recently propose third paradigm direct perception aim combine advantage use neural network learn appropriate low dimensional intermediate representation however exist direct perception approach restrict simple highway situation lack ability navigate intersection stop traffic light respect speed limit work propose direct perception approach map video input intermediate representation suitable autonomous navigation complex urban environment give high level directional input compare state of the art reinforcement conditional imitation learning approach achieve improvement 68 goal direct navigation challenge carla simulation benchmark addition approach first handle traffic light speed sign use image level label well smooth car follow result significant reduction traffic accident simulation\",\n          \"random forest rf powerful supervise learner popularly use many application bioinformatics work propose guide random forest grf feature selection similar feature selection method call guide regularize random forest grrf grf build use importance score ordinary rf however tree grrf build sequentially highly correlate allow parallel computing tree grf build independently implement parallel experiment 10 high dimensional gene datum set show fix parameter value without tune parameter rf applied feature select grf outperform rf applied feature 9 datum set 7 significant difference level therefore accuracy interpretability significantly improve grf select feature grrf however lead well classification accuracy note work guide random forest guide importance score ordinary random forest however also guide method human insight specify grf use rrf late version package also includes regularize random forest method\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
